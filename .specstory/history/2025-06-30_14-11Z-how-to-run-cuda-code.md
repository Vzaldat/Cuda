how do I run this code

_**Assistant**_

To run your CUDA code (`helloWorld.cu`), follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support.
- **CUDA Toolkit** installed (including `nvcc` compiler).
- **NVIDIA drivers** installed and working.
- **WSL2**: If using WSL2, ensure you have set up CUDA for WSL2 and your GPU is accessible.

### 2. Compile the Code
Open a terminal in your project directory and run:
```bash
nvcc helloWorld.cu -o helloWorld
```
This will compile your CUDA code and create an executable named `helloWorld`.

### 3. Run the Executable
After compiling, run:
```bash
./helloWorld
```

### 4. Troubleshooting
- If you get an error like `nvcc: command not found`, you need to install the CUDA Toolkit or add it to your PATH.
- If you get a runtime error about the GPU, make sure your drivers and CUDA are correctly set up for WSL2.

Would you like me to check if `nvcc` is installed and help you with the commands?
